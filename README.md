# BIO310-Bioinformatics
This course provided a comprehensive exploration of data science skills, covering data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization, which are essential for interpreting biological data and deriving meaningful conclusions, especially within bioinformatics. I also delved into linear regression, implementing it via scikit-learn, manual calculation, and gradient descent to illustrate core model mechanics and optimization. Additionally, polynomial regression was examined to demonstrate underfitting, overfitting, and the critical role of validation error in model selection. This work collectively honed key competencies in model evaluation, performance tuning, and understanding the bias-variance tradeoff.
